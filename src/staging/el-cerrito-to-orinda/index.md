[7.35 miles](https://www.gaiagps.com/datasummary/track/6330342820b20aa00b80150ade4e545e/?layer=GaiaTopoRasterFeet)

Immediately rising a thousand feet as it leaves Orinda, the [De Laveaga Trail](https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/east-bay/east-bay-trails) gains another five hundred feet as it cuts across the East Bay Hills, then meets Tilden Regional Park and descends back down into Berkeley. Paired with the excellent accessibility and modest distance, the constantly-rolling hills make it plenty of a challenge and, all things considered, my number one choice for a weekday trail run.

We start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station. If I've learned only one lesson on this project, it's to check the BART schedule on weekends! Trains might come every five minutes on a weekday, but you can easily find yourself waiting twenty minutes on the weekend schedule.

From Oakland, Orinda is an easy 15 minute BART ride. During the above-ground portion, I like to preview the weather by watching the hills through the window.

In conclusion, blah blah blah.
