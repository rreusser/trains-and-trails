[7.35 miles](https://www.gaiagps.com/datasummary/track/6330342820b20aa00b80150ade4e545e/?layer=GaiaTopoRasterFeet)

Immediately rising a thousand feet as it leaves Orinda, the [De Laveaga Trail](https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/east-bay/east-bay-trails) gains another five hundred feet as it cuts across the East Bay Hills, then meets Tilden Regional Park and descends back down into Berkeley. Paired with the excellent accessibility and modest distance, the constantly-rolling hills make it plenty of a challenge and, all things considered, my number one choice for a weekday trail run.

We start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station. If I've learned only one lesson on this project, it's to check the BART schedule on weekends! Trains might come every five minutes on a weekday, but you can easily find yourself waiting twenty minutes on the weekend schedule.

From Oakland, Orinda is an easy 15 minute BART ride. During the above-ground portion, I like to preview the weather by watching the hills through the window.

From the Orinda BART station, it's not more than a quarter of a mile to the De LaVeaga trailhead. It doesn't get much more convenient than that, though it requires a brief run along a sidewalk-free highway to get there.

The trail immediately rises a thousand feet as it starts back westward, giving a birds-eye view of the Orinda BART station with Mount Diablo beckoning in the background. On clear days, I like to convince myself that you can just barely catch a glimpse of the distant snow-capped Sierras.

The top of the ridge is a welcome arrival after nine hundred feet of climbing, though the running doesn't get much easier from here.

I've often found myself driving along a highway, looking longingly out the window at the rolling hills, imagining I could find myself running among them. The moment I saw the De Laveaga trail, I realized _these are the hills I look out the window and long for_. Which is ironic then, because although it's one of the most beautiful vistas in the area, the constant ups and downs prevent the running from flowing easily.

I do understand that [they're moderately invasive](https://www.kqed.org/news/11644927/eucalyptus-how-californias-most-hated-tree-took-root-2), but I just love the smell and the feel of the Bay Area's scattered eucalyptus groves.

The trail is pretty rutted at the top. It's a constant reminder the natural state of these trails doesn't involve the sort of foot traffic they see. Sadly, it looks like [East Bay trail maintenance projects](https://www.ebparks.org/trail-maintenance-volunteers) are still on hold.

At last, we're treated with a view of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge as we start the descent down into Berkeley. Photos of this view never convey the expanse and depth.

We catch the Berkeley Fire Trail admire the view of Strawberry Canyon, [LBNL](https://www.lbl.gov/), and UC Berkeley as we descend the nice, wide path down to the stadium.

To run through or to read a book upon, Berkeley's campus deserves more than the brief, goal-oriented traversal we give it here.

If we played our cards right, we now wait between one and twenty minutes to catch the BART back home. Fortunately, you can check the displays and, if you didn't time it right, enjoy a few more minutes of fresh air.

For all that the route offers, the distance is pretty modest, totalling just eight miles.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
