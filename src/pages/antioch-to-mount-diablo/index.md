I've developed somewhat of a Super Bowl tradition. After trying to get into the spirit of the day via other approaches, I've found that a distressingly long run really puts me in the right state of mind to properly enjoy an afternoon of football, just as soon as I figure out who's playing.

I've been sticking to routes closer to home though, so I wasn't sure where to go. It's tricky to keep finding new BART-accessible trail routes that aren't overly contrived and that feel worthwhile relative to the effort it takes to get there. In the spirit of expanding boundaries then, I decided to explore new territory at the end of the Antioch BART line.

My objective was to start in Antioch, run through Black Diamond Mines and Clayton Ranch Regional Preserves, then run up the North Peak of Mount Diablo (the smaller of the two peaks of Mount Diablo) and work my way back home.

It didn't quite go according to plan, but I was saved by GaiaGPS and robust Bay Area trail infrastructure.

![A view out the BART window. Elevated cement highways pass overhead.](antioch-010.jpg)

My day started at 8:11 AM as I caught the first Antioch-bound BART of the day. I would much prefer to leave at 4:30 AM and catch sunrise on top of a hill, but the trains run when the trains run.

The BART line gives you plenty of time to stare at Mount Diablo and contemplate the day ahead.

Past Bay Point, you must to transfer to a smaller train before continuing to Antioch. There was no wait, and the train is quite pleasant.

![A view of my legs as I sit on the BART. A water bottle, a hand-carry water bottle, and a Clipper card rest on my lap.](antioch-380.jpg)

The run started at about 9:15 AM. I intentionally packed quite light, carrying just a water bottle, a hand bottle, and a few energy gels. I popped into a gas station to grab a quick Gatorade and a Clif bar.

Leaving Downtown Oakland for suburbia feels like stepping into a parallel, slightly softer universe.

## Contra Loma Regional Park

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="4.5" data-split></span>
## Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="4.5"></span>
I was excited to enter the first real park of the day. [Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/BlackDiamondMines-2024-12.pdf) is three things. First, it's the ancestral homeland of the Ompin, Volvon, and Julpun tribes, second it was 19th century coal mining territory, and today it's an 8,533 acre park. The hills are modest, and I hoped this meant the running would be easier.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="4.9"></span>
![A green gully ascends bare, grassy hills.](antioch-050.jpg)

The reservoir was buzzing with mid-morning foot traffic. The hills were quiet though, and cows quickly replaced people.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="6.3"></span>
![A trail ascends a hill through rows of trees. Five cows sit along both sides of the trail.](antioch-080.jpg)

The cows sauntered out of the way as I spoke politely to them and approached slowly.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="6.85"></span>
![A line of hills, grassy in the foreground and tree-covered beyond that. Mount Diablo sits on the horizon.](antioch-110.jpg)

Cresting the hill, the North Peak of Mount Diablo stands 3,556 feet tall just over the next line of hills.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="7.5"></span>
![A beautiful green valley with a perfectly clear blue sky.](antioch-130.jpg)

An expansive valley to the south was the best view of the day.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="9"></span>
![A rocky trail fills the whole picture with a single shoe visible at the bottom.](antioch-140.jpg)

The bare hills and cow-trampled pasture give way to red sandstone and dense brush. I wasn't moving quickly, but things were easy and smooth at this point.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="9.85" data-split></span>
## ⛔️ Clayton Ranch Regional Preserve ⛔️

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="9.85"></span>
![A gate with a no trespassing sign.](antioch-160.jpg)

![A picture of a map. A blue line shows the actual trail covered, while a red line shows the intended trail.](map.jpg)

A snag. My route planning was based on the Public and Private land use layers of GaiaGPS. Clayton Ranch Regional Preserve (above, red polygon) is a 4,200-acre patchwork of acquired land belonging to [East Bay Regional Park District](https://www.ebparks.org/parks). I hoped that as public land it would be accessible, but my planned route through it (red line) was unambiguously closed to foot traffic. After a couple attempts to find an alternate route, I settled on the appropriately-named Black Diamond to Mount Diablo Regional Trail (blue line).


<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="11.5"></span>
![A sign on a blue gate reads "No tresspassing; no bicycling; no hiking; KEEP OUT." Beyond that, green fields and Mount Diablo.](antioch-180.jpg)

The connector trail is surrounded on all sides by private land, but it saved me from having to bail to Pittsburg. 

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="12.5"></span>
![A sloping, grassy hill with orchard-style trees is backlit by sun.](antioch-190.jpg)

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="13.9"></span>
![A highway extends toward Mount Diablo. A crushed gravel path lies off the side of the road.](antioch-200.jpg)

The price of this detour was a four-mile stretch on the highway which I'd hoped to avoid.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="15.8"></span>

![A country highway with a narrow shoulder. Terrain slopes steeply upward on both sides of the road.](antioch-210.jpg)

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="16.55" data-split></span>
## Mount Diablo State Park

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="16.6"></span>
![A pleasant, shaded trail winds through a grassy, tree-lined meadow.](antioch-220.jpg)

Mercifully, Mount Diablo State Park abuts the highway, and there's a perfectly pleasant trail that allows you to skip the last mile along the road.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="17.6"></span>
![A photograph of the North Peak of Mount Diablo, taken from directly below it.](antioch-230.jpg)

Finally, the main focus of the day loomed above. The Diabolical Trail is a two mile trail that averages about 27% grade (!) as it ascends 2,900 feet from the valley to the North Peak of Mount Diablo. 🔥🦵🔥

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="18.7"></span>
![A north-facing photograph taken from the trail. Hills extend into the distance, and a side-view of a grassy hillside shows the slope of the trail.](antioch-250.jpg)

Eighteen miles into the run, my legs were not fresh.

![A near-birdseye view of the hills just run. A rocky outcropping sits in the foreground.](antioch-260.jpg)

On a clear day, you can see about 90 miles east to snow-capped peaks of the Sierras.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="20.12"></span>
![Summit selfie with hills in the background.](antioch-270.jpg)

The summit of the North Peak marked the division between the nice part of the day's run and _the rest of it_.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="21.05" data-split></span>
## Prospector's Gap

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="21.1"></span>

In my younger years, I'd have made quick run up to the main peak of Mount Diablo, but I focused on just getting home in once piece.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="22.0"></span>
![A view of the North Peak as I begin to descend.](antioch-290.jpg)

The eastern slopes were warming in the midday sun, so I was surprised to see north-facing ridge trail still lined with frost.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="23.68"></span>
![A similar view of the North Peak together with the main peak of Mount Diablo.](antioch-300.jpg)

By 23 miles, plantar fasciitis set in, and what should have been a victorious descent down the final ridge was a heavy slog down the hill.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="24.8"></span>

![A trail winds through a grassy meadow along a sloping hill.](antioch-310.jpg)


<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="25.5"></span>

![One last view from the hills of the road which will be run shortly.](antioch-320.jpg)

The road to Clayton extends into the distance. My attention began to fixate on weekend bus schedules.


<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="26.2"></span>

![A view of the road back to Clayton.](antioch-340.jpg)

I spent the last two miles of the run fighting the Apple Maps interface, trying to get it to refresh both my current position and the time remaining before arrival of the bus.


<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="0"></span>
## County Connector 310

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="0"></span>

The bus runs every 40 minutes on weekends, so I was very pleased to wait only about five minutes.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="0"></span>
## Concord

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="0.1"></span>
![The BART approaches the Concord station.](antioch-360.jpg)

After another brief wait for the BART, I rested my legs and enjoyed the ride home.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="6.0"></span>
![A view of Mount Diablo from Walnut Creek.](antioch-370.jpg)

Already a distant memory.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="17.0"></span>
![A photo of the BART door. A diagram shows a person holding the doors open, but it looks more like someone holding cross-country skiis. A sticker is pasted over the original text which reads "NO cross-country skiing."](antioch-390.jpg)

Whoever printed these stickers to perfectly cover the "DO NOT hold doors" signs on the BART, you have a big fan here.


<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="25"></span>
## 12th Street Oakland

<span data-behavior="conclusion"></span>

![A dog watches the Super Bowl.](antioch-400.jpg)

And that's that. The route turned out alright, but my persistent plantar fasciitis has made these runs less fun than they used to be. It doesn't kick in until about 20 miles, so you could look at it as karma, either for undertaking these runs at all or for failing to keep up with my assigned calf-raises. With everything going on in the present world though, I have the ability to get outside for a trail run, so painful or not, so I can't complain.

I was a bit disappointed by the detour. I looked up Clayton Ranch Regional Preserve and wasn't quickly able to find out that it was definitely open or definitely closed to the public. I appreciate that GaiaGPS is a tool and not a crowd-sourced source of truth and certainly don't feel that it misled. I just wish that it were a bit easier to find more direct information about trail conditions without having to cross-reference maps with every web search link you can click.

At any rate though, I'm content with this route. If I'd taken a book to read on the train and cut off the Mount Diablo section, this would have been quite a nice, runnable fourteen-mile route. I would definitely _either_ do this run in the winter when the heat is forgiving _or_ drive to the trail so that I could start earlier than 9:00 AM though.

Super Bowl was great. Dog loved it. I ate some chips, pizza, and half the veggie platter. Until next time. 👋

Go team! 🎉
