Hi, my name is Ricky. üëã I've run for many years, but logging, quantifying, and analyzing my own running has always struck me as profoundly uninteresting. Quite simply, it's the running itself which I enjoy.

Things change though. I used to cruise for miles along gravel roads of the Midwest, but my tendons now prefer a more moderately-paced slog up a steep hill. The monotony of gravel roads used to leave my head empty and calm, but dodging cars as I run through Oakland only leaves my head full of fear and anger. I have plenty of Opinions about cars, but I'm not sure anyone wants to know, and I don't enjoy [shouting into the void](https://twitter.com/).

This blog represents my effort to channel frustration and ill-informed policy opinions into something positive.

The ground rules are simple: I start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station and see how far I can get on a couple energy gels and a BART card. I haven't decided if I'll limit my runs to the Bay Area. At the time of writing, I don't know the bus system very well so I'll probably have to learn it. Ride shares are out of bounds.

This blog is made from scratch with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). You can find the source on GitHub at [rreusser/trains-and-trails](https://github.com/rreusser/trains-and-trails). It's MIT licensed and IMO not actually too bad, though you'll probably be hard-pressed to repurpose too much of it without significant rewrites. You're welcome to try!
