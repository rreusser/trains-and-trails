Hi, my name is Ricky. üëã I'm a runner and software developer in the Bay Area. I've run for many years and have tried a few times to start logging or quantifying my running as I've worked in data visualization and now mapping. It never stuck though. It's the running itself which I enjoy.

Things change though. I used to cruise for miles along gravel roads of the Midwest, but my tendons now prefer a more moderately-paced slog up a steep hill. Gravel roads are a great place to empty your head and train for a marathon, but dodging cars on the streets of Oakland‚Äîor *being* one‚Äîonly leaves my head full of fear and anger.

Time and city life have changed what running means to me, and this blog represents my desire to channel all of this into something positive, to convey the simple excitement of walking out the door with shoes and a metro card and finding something unexpected. 

The ground rules are simple: I start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station and see how far I can get on a couple energy gels and a Clipper Card. I haven't decided if I'll limit my runs to the Bay Area. At the time of writing, I don't know the bus system very well so I'll have to learn it. Ride shares are out-of-bounds.

If there are a couple things which make the running possible, it's [Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/) shoes and [GaiaGPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/) maps. This blog is made from scratch with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) (full disclosure: I work at Mapbox!) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). You can find the source on GitHub at [rreusser/trains-and-trails](https://github.com/rreusser/trains-and-trails). It's MIT licensed and perhaps not the worst, though you'll probably be hard-pressed to repurpose too much of it without significant rewrites. You're welcome to try!
