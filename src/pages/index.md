Hi! I'm Ricky. This site presents a small collection of Bay Area trails I've run via public transportation. I've generally found that it takes roughly three times longer to hike a trail than to run, so if you use this as any sort of guide, plan ahead, bring plenty of water, and be forewarned that they're relatively long routes!
