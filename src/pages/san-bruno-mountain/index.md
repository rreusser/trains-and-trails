If there's one hill that every visitor to San Francisco sees as they leave the airport, it's San Bruno Mountain. The only run at the time of writing for which I've crossed the bay, I really can't believe in hindsight that I put this run off for so long.

The run starts with a gently upward-sloping two mile approach. I'd imagined that somewhere along the approach, a gap in the houses would expose a vista of San Francisco, but I never found it.

The start of the trail section immediately launches you into another world.

The real fun starts three and a half miles into the run. At 600 feet of sustained climbing though, it's not actually as significant a climb as it appears from a distance.

The top of the ridge is everything I hoped it'd be. I certainly didn't expect it would fee so isolated from the city of eight million people which surrounds it.

The halfway point is a bit anti-climactic, as the trail simply steepens and fades as it approaches Highway 101. From what I can tell, there's really not much but to either slip and fall or find yourself lost in the brush, at which point it only makes sense to turn around.

Whether it was the terrain or simply that I no longer had to expend energy wondering where I was going, the return trip was the real treat. My mind wandered away from me, and the gently rolling miles ticked by pretty effortlessly. This is the segment which made the trip worthwhile.
