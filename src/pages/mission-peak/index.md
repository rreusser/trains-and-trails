At just under 2500 feet of climbing, Mission Peak begs to be climbed. Having a good experience on it requires a bit of care though. Two things you can count on are that *it will be sunny, and it will be busy.* On a regular weekend, you can easily expect to see a couple hundred fellow travelers on the trail.

It's a straight shot on the BART from Oakland to Mission Peak. At about a 35-minute trip, the duration is nearly identical to the drive along Interstate 880 and frankly much more pleasant.

The approach from the Warm Springs BART station slopes very gently upward and has relatively little traffic. While the running was easy, I found I'd dressed for the midday sun and was woefully unprepared for the chilly morning temperatures.

One thing I wrestled with when starting this project—which in fact prevented me from taking it on earlier—was navigating how to bring out the simple enjoyment of public-transit-powered trail running without turning it into a snarky, backhanded jab at cars. So it's with only the warmest enthusiasm for all the hikers who woke up on a Saturday morning and declared "Today is a good day to hike a 2500-foot hill!" that I have to note my surprise at the hundreds of cars lining every road leading to the trailhead. Rather than viewing it as any sort of reflection on those who drove though, it only made me sad that you have to be a completely unreasonable trail-running nut for a couple miles through the suburbs not to be the barrier that completely dictate how you get around the city.

A rare luxury, the trailhead features bathrooms and water!

Even on a warm day, you can expect a nice drop in temperature and increase in wind speed as you reach the top of Mission Peak.

You can easily find yourself sharing the summit of Mission Peak with fifty other people, but an additional quarter of a mile across the ridge brings you to a secluded valley which winds along the top of the ridge. In three trips to Mission Peak, I've only ever seen one mountain biker and some cows. As much as I don't mind a busy trial—perhaps even *because* of the busy trail you travel to get there—the solitude and serenity is really quite striking.
