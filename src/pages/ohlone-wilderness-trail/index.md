I've wanted to run the Ohlone Wilderness Trail through [Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone) for years now. Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, we hiked [twelve miles out and back](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/murietta-falls-trail) from Lake Del Valle to Murietta Falls. It was about the sunniest and most idyllic meadows I've wandered around in, but the elevation gain is significant and it was intimidating to appreciate that we'd hardly even scratched the surface of the trail system.

And so the Ohlone Trail has remained on my to-do list for a number of reasons. First is the nature of the trail itself. The Ohlone Trail starts at [Lake Del Valle](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/del-valle) and spans about 27 miles, passing through [Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone) and [Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol) before traversing [Misson Peak Regional Preserve](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission-peak) and ending in Fremont. The trail is very committing, with essentially no option to bail except to complete the first twenty miles to Sunol (at which point hopefully you were able to convince a friend to come to your rescue) or to go back the way you came. (Fortunately, cell service was actually much better than I expected.)

Additional factors contributed. Sunol was closed for a good share of 2023 due to damage resulting from the unusually rainy season, and even when open, it's a far better trail in the winter due to high summertime temperatures and sun exposure. And finally, it requires a [trail permit](https://www.ebparks.org/rentals-and-permits/permits/ohlone-wilderness) which although it only took five minutes to order—and is by a wide margin the nicest trail permit I've ever received—this small hurdle was enough to prevent an impulse decision once or twice.

This time was different though. I had my trail pass and I had a date. A Tuesday, when the buses run a bit earlier, so that I could get as early a start as possible. But I got impatient on a Saturday morning at 8:30 AM, so I threw it all to the wind, grabbed my stuff, and ran out the door to make it happen.

## Lake Merritt Station

![A BART station selfie](ohlone-wilderness-trail-000.jpg)

Despite having learned to plan ahead on weekends, once the impulse decision had been made, I grabbed everything I thought I'd need, ran for the Lake Merritt BART Station without checking the schedule, and fortunately only had to wait about two minutes for the next train.

I almost certainly carried too much, but knowing any real mishap would likely have me spending the night outside, I came prepared.

![Trail map](trail-map-1.jpg)

![Trail map closeup](trail-map-2.jpg)

Along the way, I reviewed the map. When I received my trail pass in the mail, I opened up a detailed topographic map and was surprised to realize that the map, with date stamped in the corner, *is* the trail pass—which you are required to have with you at all times. There's a saying, "Safety rules are written in blood." It means they don't institute safety rules until something goes badly wrong. So I hope nothing too unfortunate had to happen for [EBRPD](https://www.ebparks.org/) to take what feels like an unusually heavy-handed approach with the pass, but at any rate, I was pretty happy with the result.

## 10R Bus to Livermore

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="1" data-mile-position="0"></span>
![Waiting for the 10R](ohlone-wilderness-trail-010.jpg)

The twenty minute wait for the 10R bus to Livermore wasn't too bad, and there was even a bathroom at the station—which, when you're stuck at a bus stop trying to overhydrate in preparation for a long day outside, is a big plus.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="0"></span>
## Livermore

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="0"></span>
I hopped off the bus at the point of closest approach to Lake Del Valle and began the day right at 10:00 AM. Given the scale of the day, it was, to say the least, an inadvisably late start.

I figured if I could average 5 miles per hour and the route came out to 45 miles, that would put me at about 9 hours and a finishing time of 7:00 PM. It would be dark, but not problematically so. Naturally it was at this point I realized I'd forgotton my headlamp.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="1.2"></span>
![The bike path near Livermore](ohlone-wilderness-trail-020.jpg)

The bike path was quite nice and allowed to skip running along any busy roads.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="2"></span>
Slightly nervous about bonking in the middle of a wilderness area, I slammed the Gatorade I'd been carrying and stopped by a gas station for a replacement Gatorade, a Clif Bar, and a bag of Lay's potato chips.

## Sycamore Grove Park

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="3.52"></span>

Sycamore Grove Park is a lovely, flat, open park. It was nice to see so many people, many of them perhaps getting an active start to their winter break, out walking and biking with their families.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="4.6"></span>
![Trees and shade on the plains of Sycamore Grove Park](ohlone-wilderness-trail-030.jpg)

I had a hard time finding my intended route, but the trails seemed to go the same direction as they forked all over the plain.

## Del Valle Regional Park

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="6.4"></span>
![A brushy creek bed marks a possible entrance to Lake Del Valle Park](ohlone-wilderness-trail-040.jpg)

One big fear was that I'd burn precious time and miles on wrong turns or dead-end trails on private land. I had a bad feeling as I scrambled down a six foot vertical embankment to a brushy river bed below, but the trail got me where I needed to go.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="7.6"></span>
![Looking back from the first hill near Del Valle, a green golf course stands out among the dry rolling hills](ohlone-wilderness-trail-050.jpg)

I felt more at home as I finally started to gain some elevation.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="8.1"></span>
![A rather uninspired photograph of a moderately inspiring lake](ohlone-wilderness-trail-060.jpg)

Del Valle is an outstanding and scenic trail run. It's a bit of a drive to get there, but a trail wraps around the north side of the lake for at least seven miles. Out and back, that's more than enough for a nice, quiet long run.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="10.3"></span>
![A trail winds through the hills near Lake Del Valle](ohlone-wilderness-trail-070.jpg)

The running was quite good, but the rolling hills weren't as easy or brief as I expected.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="11.9"></span>
![A trail winds through a small grove of trees](ohlone-wilderness-trail-080.jpg)

## Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="15.9"></span>
![A standard downward-facing photo of legs and shoes on a dry path](ohlone-wilderness-trail-100.jpg)

The smooth running stopped immediately as soon as I stepped onto the Ohlone Trail. I grew a bit nervous, as sixteen miles is a long way to run just to find yourself stepping onto the *beginning* of a marathon-length trail.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="16.5"></span>
![Looking out of a valley toward serene hills and a blue sky](ohlone-wilderness-trail-110.jpg)

The scenery was lovely though, and the near-solstice sun angle was very forgiving.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="18.45"></span>
![Looking down the next valley, small pedestrians hike up a winding trail](ohlone-wilderness-trail-120.jpg)

It was nice to see a few of the only people I'd see all day, but it was moderately discouraging to descend 500 feet into a valley, just to immediately ascend the other side.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="20.9"></span>
![A pond and scattered trees sit atop a grassy meadown](ohlone-wilderness-trail-125.jpg)

The photos don't do it justice, and it's hard to put into words just how pleasant the top of the ridge is. It feels like the sort of place where you spread out a picnic blanket, pull a book out of your backpack, and then just stare at the clouds for a few hours.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="22.5"></span>
![A closeup of a topographic map showing the southeast corner of the route](trail-map-3.jpg)

As I approached the southeast corner of the route, it felt like a big accomplishment—even if I was only halfway done—to turn the corner and start heading back west toward San Francisco Bay.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="23.4"></span>
![A wide path winds along a ridge dotted by leafless trees](ohlone-wilderness-trail-130.jpg)

I slowly watched my average pace drop throughout the day from 7.5 miles per hour, down to 6 miles per hour, and then into the fives. In this region though, the running flowed and I felt like I was able to at least prevent it from dropping further.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="25.3"></span>
![Looking along a path, San Francisco Bay is visible on the horizon as the hillside falls off toward the left](ohlone-wilderness-trail-140.jpg)

After ascending the previous valley, I was painfully well aware I had probably not less than twenty miles remaining. If I'd known Rose Peak would be the high point of the entire day, I wouldn't have skipped the summit, but alas, I skirted around it, cutting off an extra one or two hundred feet of elevation gain.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="25.4"></span>
![A selfie](ohlone-wilderness-trail-150.jpg)

Another selfie, this time with the glossy finish mostly worn off.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="26.9"></span>
![A path winds downhill into the distance. Mission Peak is visible on the horizon.](ohlone-wilderness-trail-160.jpg)

Miles of rolling hills unfolded into the distance with Mission Peak (rightmost peak just touching the horizon) visible on the horizon.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="27.9"></span>
![Similar to the previous photograph, Mission Peak is still visible on the horizon](ohlone-wilderness-trail-170.jpg)

A mile later, Mission Peak seemed not even slightly closer.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="29.2"></span>

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="29.25" data-split></span>
## Sunol Regional Wilderness Preserve

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="30.5"></span>
![A single track path cuts across a hillside with Misson Peak now poking slightly above the horizon](ohlone-wilderness-trail-190.jpg)

At this point the trail switched to single track, as it would remain for most of the remaining descent to the Sunol staging area.

I was somewhat disappointed that a ten mile rolling descent with stunning views could actually feel so unpleasant, but the previous thirty miles of running and ten pounds of gear and water had taken their toll. My brain was happy, but my legs were not.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="32.9"></span>
![Looking eastward, the moon rises above warm-colored hills](ohlone-wilderness-trail-200.jpg)

I was encouraged looking back east, hoping that a waxing gibbous moon would substitute for a forgotten headlamp.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="34.9"></span>

I stopped at the Sunol staging area and sat on a picnic table for at least five minutes. I ate the rest of my potato chips and Clif bar, knowing the final ascent up Mission Peak would require all the potato chips I could throw at it.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="35.7"></span>
![Looking back eastward, the sun casts a warm glow on the only the topmost hills as the moon rises](ohlone-wilderness-trail-210.jpg)

The views briefly got better and better as the sun set.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="36.1"></span>
![Looking out toward Pleasanton, the setting sun casts a warm glow on the shadowed hills](ohlone-wilderness-trail-220.jpg)

With some food and gatorade in me, my spirits finally lifted. The back side of Mission Peak was surprisingly gradual and runnable.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="38.8"></span>
![A cow stares at me in the fading light](ohlone-wilderness-trail-225.jpg)

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="39.4"></span>
![Near Misson Peak, looking toward Pleasanton, the starting point of Livermore is now only a glow on the horizon](ohlone-wilderness-trail-230.jpg)

Looking back east, Livermore was little more than a glow of lights on the horizon.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="39.8"></span>
![Looking over the top of Mission Peak, the sun glows orange and blue as the lights begin to illuminate the Bay Area](ohlone-wilderness-trail-240.jpg)

The light faded as I crested Misson Peak and the lights of the Bay Area came into view. A small tree with lights stood near the summit.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="2" data-mile-position="41.0"></span>
![Looking back up toward Misson Peak, the moon rises as nighttime falls](ohlone-wilderness-trail-250.jpg)

Disappointingly, my legs preferred climbing at this point, so that the descent from Misson Peak was not nearly as pleasant as usual.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="0"></span>
## Warm Springs/South Fremont Station

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="0.0"></span>
![The BART arrives at Warm Springs/South Fremont](ohlone-wilderness-trail-260.jpg)

I waited for only a matter of seconds before the train pulled into the station.

<span data-behavior="anchor" data-feature-index="3" data-mile-position="28.0"></span>
## 12th Street Oakland

<span data-behavior="conclusion"></span>

All in all, the Ohlone Wilderness Trail was every bit as stunning as I hoped it would be. I was ever so slightly disappointed that the wide trails and cow fences made it feel more like cow pasture than any sort of wilderness, but given that it's hardly even a short hop away from the Bay Area, I'm certainly not complaining.

What I didn't expect is that carrying a few pounds of water would take such a toll on my legs and back. One thing I'd do significantly better in the future would be to bring a water filter. Part of me isn't eager to start looking for water spigots and messing around with water filters in the middle of a run, but another part of me—my legs, in particular—thinks it would more than offset the cost of carrying liquids on such a lengthy run.

I would *love* to run this trail again with a water filter, maybe even just sacrificing my principles by driving right to the trailhead or getting picked up at Sunol. The running was so generally forgiving that the real challenge in this route turned out primarily just to be the sheer distance required to make it work via public transportation.
