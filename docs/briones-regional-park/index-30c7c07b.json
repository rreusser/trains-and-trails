So by the weekend, I was pretty eager to get outside, but maybe only for something relaxing.</p><p>I've figured out alright by now how to do completely unreasonably long runs via the BART, but It's a feature of the spread-out BART lines that there aren't many stations you can connect with a relatively modest trail run. The De Laveaga trail from Orinda to Berkeley is one of the few that works out very well.</p><p>So in my push to cover more territory on the blog, I decided the day had arrived to try Briones Regional Park. I've run through it just once before, and it was… great. Stopping to think about it, I couldn't figured out why I hadn't returned.</p><p>I mapped out a route for about a half marathon, allowing for some creative routefinding along the way, grabbed a water bottle and a couple energy gels, and headed out the door.</p></div><div class=\"articleCards\"><div class=\"articleCards_marker\"><div class=\"articleCards_markerInner\"></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>12th Street Oakland</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:4200px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"briones-regional-park/IMG_8976-md-1bcc70e4.jpg\" alt=\"A BART train arrives at the station\"></p><p>I arrived at the BART station at about 10:31 AM, just as the train was rolling into the station.

It's not huge, but there's a lot to explore. A surprising amount of the park has sweeping views in every direction.</p><p>I won't overdo the praise since \"best trail I've run in X area\" is becoming a bit of a Trains and Trails cliche. The only thing I'll add is that if you see only one section, I'd aim for the southeast section of the park.
