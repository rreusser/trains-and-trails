<a href="https://www.gaiagps.com/public/w6tnBZEZzYqkgbiSJVRfrPGV/">View on GaiaGPS →</a></p><p>I've wanted to run the Ohlone Wilderness Trail through <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone">Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> for years now. Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, we hiked <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/murietta-falls-trail">twelve miles out and back</a> from Lake Del Valle to Murietta Falls. The sunny, expansive meadows are idyllic, but the elevation gain is significant and it was intimidating to appreciate that we'd hardly even scratched the surface of the trail system.</p><p>The Ohlone Trail has remained on my to-do list for a number of reasons. First is the nature of the trail itself. The Ohlone Trail starts at <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/del-valle">Lake Del Valle</a> and spans about 27 miles, passing through <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone">Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> and <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol">Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> before traversing <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission-peak">Misson Peak Regional Preserve</a> and ending in Fremont. The trail is <em>very</em> committing, with essentially no option to bail except to complete the first twenty miles to Sunol (at which point hopefully you were able to convince a friend to come to your rescue) or to go back the way you came.</p><p>Additional factors contributed. Sunol was closed for a good share of 2023 due to damage resulting from the unusually rainy season, and even when open, it's a far better trail in the winter due to high summertime temperatures and sun exposure. And finally, it requires a <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/rentals-and-permits/permits/ohlone-wilderness">trail permit</a> which although it only took five minutes to order—and is by a wide margin the nicest trail permit I've ever received—this small hurdle was enough to prevent an impulse decision once or twice.</p></div><div class="articleCards"><div class="articleCards_marker"><div class="articleCards_markerInner"></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="0" style="min-height:0px"><div class="articleCard_station"><h2>Lake Merritt Station</h2></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-metro" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="0" style="min-height:2000px"><div class="articleCard_content"><p>

I hopped off the bus at the point of closest approach to Lake Del Valle and began the day right at 10:00 AM.

Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, we hiked <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/murietta-falls-trail\">twelve miles out and back</a> from Lake Del Valle to Murietta Falls. The sunny, expansive meadows are idyllic, but the elevation gain is significant and it was intimidating to appreciate that we'd hardly even scratched the surface of the trail system.</p><p>The Ohlone Trail has remained on my to-do list for a number of reasons. First is the nature of the trail itself. The Ohlone Trail starts at <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/del-valle\">Lake Del Valle</a> and spans about 27 miles, passing through <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone\">Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol\">Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> before traversing <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission-peak\">Misson Peak Regional Preserve</a> and ending in Fremont. The trail is <em>very</em> committing, with essentially no option to bail except to complete the first twenty miles to Sunol (at which point hopefully you were able to convince a friend to come to your rescue) or to go back the way you came.</p><p>Additional factors contributed. Sunol was closed for a good share of 2023 due to damage resulting from the unusually rainy season, and even when open, it's a far better trail in the winter due to high summertime temperatures and sun exposure. And finally, it requires a <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/rentals-and-permits/permits/ohlone-wilderness\">trail permit</a> which although it only took five minutes to order—and is by a wide margin the nicest trail permit I've ever received—this small hurdle was enough to prevent an impulse decision once or twice.</p></div><div class=\"articleCards\"><div class=\"articleCards_marker\"><div class=\"articleCards_markerInner\"></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>Lake Merritt Station</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:2000px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/ohlone-wilderness-trail-000-md-ed7a6ace.jpg\" alt=\"A BART station selfie\"></p><p>Despite <a href=\"trains-and-trails/mount-tam-golden-gate-loop/\">having learned to plan ahead</a>, once the impulse decision had been made, I grabbed everything I thought I'd need, ran for the Lake Merritt BART Station without checking the schedule, and fortunately only had to wait about two minutes for the next train.</p><p>I almost certainly carried too much, but knowing any real mishap would likely have me spending the night outside, I came prepared.</p><ul>\n<li>1 backpack with small Camelbak bladder and two 18 oz water bottles</li>\n<li>1 waist belt with 24 oz water bottle</li>\n<li>2 28 oz bottles Gatorade</li>\n<li>1 18 oz hand bottle</li>\n<li>10 energy gels</li>\n<li>ACR ResQLink 400 Personal Locator Beacon</li>\n<li>Backup phone battery</li>\n<li>Lightweight jacket</li>\n<li>Trail pass/map + sharpie</li>\n<li>Hat, sunglasses, buff</li>\n</ul></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0.16979561435632312\" style=\"min-height:9750px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/trail-map-1-md-22160f2f.jpg\" alt=\"Trail map\"></p><p><img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/trail-map-2-md-2e3e92e8.jpg\" alt=\"Trail map closeup\"></p><p>Along the way, I reviewed the map.
