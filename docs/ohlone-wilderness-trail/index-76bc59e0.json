Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, we hiked <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/murietta-falls-trail\">twelve miles out and back</a> from Lake Del Valle to Murietta Falls. It was about the sunniest and most idyllic meadows I've wandered around in, but the elevation gain is significant and it was intimidating to appreciate that we'd hardly even scratched the surface of the trail system.</p><p>And so the Ohlone Trail has remained on my to-do list for a number of reasons. First is the nature of the trail itself. The Ohlone Trail starts at <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/del-valle\">Lake Del Valle</a> and spans about 27 miles, passing through <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone\">Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol\">Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> before traversing <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission-peak\">Misson Peak Regional Preserve</a> and ending in Fremont. The trail is very committing, with essentially no option to bail except to complete the first twenty miles to Sunol (at which point hopefully you were able to convince a friend to come to your rescue) or to go back the way you came. (Fortunately, cell service was actually much better than I expected.)</p><p>Additional factors contributed. Sunol was closed for a good share of 2023 due to damage resulting from the unusually rainy season, and even when open, it's a far better trail in the winter due to high summertime temperatures and sun exposure. And finally, it requires a <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/rentals-and-permits/permits/ohlone-wilderness\">trail permit</a> which although it only took five minutes to order—and is by a wide margin the nicest trail permit I've ever received—this small hurdle was enough to prevent an impulse decision once or twice.</p><p>This time was different though. I had my trail pass and I had a date. A Tuesday, when the buses run a bit earlier, so that I could get as early a start as possible. But I got impatient on a Saturday morning at 8:30 AM, so I threw it all to the wind, grabbed my stuff, and ran out the door to make it happen.</p></div><div class=\"articleCards\"><div class=\"articleCards_marker\"><div class=\"articleCards_markerInner\"></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>Lake Merritt Station</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:1200px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/ohlone-wilderness-trail-000-md-ed7a6ace.jpg\" alt=\"A BART station selfie\"></p><p>Despite having learned to plan ahead on weekends, once the impulse decision had been made, I grabbed everything I thought I'd need, ran for the Lake Merritt BART Station without checking the schedule, and fortunately only had to wait about two minutes for the next train.</p><p>I almost certainly carried too much, but knowing any real mishap would likely have me spending the night outside, I came prepared.</p><ul>\n<li>1 backpack with small Camelbak bladder and two 18 oz water bottles</li>\n<li>1 waist belt with 24 oz water bottle</li>\n<li>2 28 oz bottles Gatorade</li>\n<li>1 18 oz hand bottle</li>\n<li>10 energy gels</li>\n<li>ACR ResQLink 400 Personal Locator Beacon</li>\n<li>Backup phone battery</li>\n<li>Lightweight jacket</li>\n<li>Trail pass/map + sharpie</li>\n<li>Hat, sunglasses, buff</li>\n</ul></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0.16979561435632312\" style=\"min-height:5850px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/trail-map-1-md-22160f2f.jpg\" alt=\"Trail map\"></p><p><img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/trail-map-2-md-2e3e92e8.jpg\" alt=\"Trail map closeup\"></p><p>Along the way, I reviewed the map.

One thing I'd do significantly better in the future would be to bring a water filter. Part of me isn't eager to start looking for water spigots and messing around with water filters in the middle of a run, but another part of me—my legs, in particular—thinks it would more than offset the cost of carrying liquids on such a lengthy run.</p><p>I would <em>love</em> to run this trail again with a water filter, maybe even just sacrificing my principles by driving right to the trailhead or getting picked up at Sunol. The running was so generally forgiving that the real challenge in this route turned out primarily just to be the sheer distance required to make it work via public transportation.</p><p><a
