Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, we hiked <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/murietta-falls-trail\">twelve miles out and back</a> from Lake Del Valle to Murietta Falls. It was idyllic and intimidating to run through beautiful meadows knowing you've barely even scratched the surface of the trail system.</p><p>The Ohlone Trail has remained on my to-do list for a number of reasons though. First is the nature of the trail itself. The Ohlone Trail starts at <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/del-valle\">Lake Del Valle</a> and spans about 27 miles, passing through <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone\">Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol\">Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> before traversing <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission-peak\">Misson Peak Regional Preserve</a> and ending in Fremont. The trail is <em>very</em> committing, with essentially no option to bail except to finish the trail, go back the way you came, or attempt to coordinate with your best friend to rescue you at Sunol, already twenty miles into the trail.</p><p>Additionally, Sunol was closed for a good share of 2023 due to the unusually rainy season. It's a better winter trail than a summer trail due to temperatures and sun exposure. And finally, it requires a <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/rentals-and-permits/permits/ohlone-wilderness\">trail permit</a> which although it only took five minutes to order—and is by a wide margin the nicest trail permit I've ever received—the small hurdle was enough to prevent an impulse decision once or twice.</p></div><div class=\"articleCards\"><div class=\"articleCards_marker\"><div class=\"articleCards_markerInner\"></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>Lake Merritt Station</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:11778px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/ohlone-wilderness-trail-000-md-ed7a6ace.jpg\" alt=\"A BART station selfie\"></p><p>Despite previous experiences in which I <a href=\"trains-and-trails/mount-tam-golden-gate-loop/\">suggested I'd learned otherwise</a>, once the impulse decision had been made, I grabbed everything I thought I'd need, ran for the Lake Merritt BART Station without checking the schedule, and fortunately only had to wait about two minutes for the next train.</p></div><svg class=\"articleCard_circleCutoff\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\"><path d=\"M 0 0 L 20 0 L 20 10 A 14.5 14.5 0 0 0 0 10 Z\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-bus articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>Dublin/Pleasanton Station</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-bus\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"ohlone-wilderness-trail/ohlone-wilderness-trail-010-md-f9cd7abb.jpg\" alt=\"Waiting for the 10R\"></p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-bus\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1\" style=\"min-height:49332px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>10R to Livermore</h2><p>The twenty minute wait for the 10R bus to Livermore wasn't too bad, and there was even a bathroom at the station—which, when you're trying hard to overhydrate in preparation for a long day outside is no small amenity.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-start articleCard-metro\" style=\"min-height:4500px\"></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-terminus\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"3.3237828053808487\" style=\"min-height:9398px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>12th Street Oakland</h2></div></div></div><div class=\"articleContent articleContent--conclusion\" data-route-mode=\"bound\"><p>I've not often been so satisfied with a run and so relieved to return home.
