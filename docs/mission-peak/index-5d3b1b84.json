Having a good experience on it requires a bit of care though. Two things you can count on are that <em>it will be sunny, and it will be busy.</em> On a regular weekend, you can easily expect to see a couple hundred fellow travelers on the trail.</p></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>12th Street Oakland</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:14210px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\nIt's a straight shot on the BART from Oakland to Mission Peak.

So it's with only the warmest enthusiasm for all the hikers who woke up on a Saturday morning and declared \"Today is a good day to hike a 2500-foot hill!\" that I have to note my surprise at the hundreds of cars lining every road leading to the trailhead. Rather than viewing it as any sort of reflection on those who drove though, it only made me sad that you have to be a completely unreasonable trail-running nut for a couple miles through the suburbs not to be the barrier that completely dictate how you get around the city.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-foot\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.1769772104272538\" style=\"min-height:2500px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\nA rare luxury, the trailhead features bathrooms and water!</p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-foot\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.3408449978598962\" style=\"min-height:800px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\nEven on a warm day, you can expect a nice drop in temperature and increase in wind speed as you reach the top of Mission Peak.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-foot\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.3932826898383417\" style=\"min-height:9256px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\nYou can easily find yourself sharing the summit of Mission Peak with fifty other people, but an additional quarter of a mile across the ridge brings you to a secluded valley which winds along the top of the ridge. In three trips to Mission Peak, I've only ever seen one mountain biker and some cows. As much as I don't mind a busy trial—perhaps even <em>because</em> of the busy trail you travel to get there—the solitude and serenity is really quite striking.</p></div><svg class=\"articleCard_circleCutoff\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\"><path d=\"M 0 0 L 20 0 L 20 10 A 14.5 14.5 0 0 0 0 10 Z\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"2\" style=\"min-height:14210px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>Warm Springs/South Fremont</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-terminus\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"2.999977911496684\" style=\"min-height:0px\"><div class=\"articleCard_station\"><h2>12th Street Oakland</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleContent articleContent--conclusion\" data-route-mode=\"bound\"><p><a href=\"\">Back</a></p></div>","metadata":{"title":"Mission Peak","date":"May 21, 2022","path":"mission-peak/","routeurl":"mission-peak/route-de51e16b.json","bounds":[-121.93926,37.48461,-121.86521,37.51763]},"baseURL":"/"}
