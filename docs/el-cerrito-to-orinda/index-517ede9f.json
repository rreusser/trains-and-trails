Paired with the excellent accessibility and modest distance, the constantly-rolling hills make it plenty of a challenge and, all things considered, my number one choice for a weekday trail run.</p></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start articleCard-terminus\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\" style=\"min-height:28255px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p><img src=\"el-cerrito-to-orinda/placeholder-md-e9102451.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p><p>We start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station. If I've learned only one lesson on this project, it's to check the BART schedule on weekends! Trains might come every five minutes on a weekday, but you can easily find yourself waiting twenty minutes on the weekend schedule.</p><p>From Oakland, Orinda is an easy 15 minute BART ride. During the above-ground portion, I like to preview the weather by watching the hills through the window.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleContent articleContent--conclusion\" data-route-mode=\"bound\"><p>In conclusion, blah blah blah.</p><p><a href=\"\">Back</a></p></div>","metadata":{"title":"El Cerrito to Orinda","date":"June 4, 2022","assets":{"placeholder":{"sm":"placeholder-sm-e9102451.jpg","md":"placeholder-md-e9102451.jpg","lg":"placeholder-lg-e9102451.jpg"}},"ratings":{"Accessibility":5,"Wilderness":3,"Hills":4,"Scenery":4},"path":"el-cerrito-to-orinda/","routeurl":"el-cerrito-to-orinda/route-f32e4648.json","bounds":[-122.32802,37.87513,-122.18429,37.95669]},"baseURL":"/"}
