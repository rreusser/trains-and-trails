<p>Immediately rising a thousand feet as it leaves Orinda, the <a href="https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/east-bay/east-bay-trails">De Laveaga Trail</a> gains another five hundred feet as it cuts across the East Bay Hills, then meets Tilden Regional Park and descends back down into Berkeley. Paired with the excellent accessibility and modest distance, the constantly-rolling hills make it plenty of a challenge and, all things considered, my number one choice for a weekday trail run.</p>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
