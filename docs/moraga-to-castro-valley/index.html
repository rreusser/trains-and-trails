Alas, access was pretty definitively blocked by a locked gate. I'm certain a hop and a hundred meter jog would have put me on the connector trail, but I generally prefer to color inside the lines as far as trail access goes. I'm not generally impressed with some of the routes I've seen online where, out of disregard rather than any sort of need or even confusion, people simply cut across whatever land they please.

Though I still had an untouched 32 ounce water bottle, a quick stop by Safeway for pineapple juice and Gummy Lifesavers was worth the trouble.

After a few moments of reflection, I'm willing to say that this is the best route I've run in the East Bay. Maybe not a route I'll run all that frequently, but definitely the most inspiring.</p><p>The distance wasn't exceptional, but more than most, this route felt remarkably far away from everything—from anything. I wonder if that feeling would hold up upon repeating. Part of me knows that it's all just cow pasture, but for a moment while I was running, I let the trail take me away and I forgot about everything except putting one foot in front of the other and wondering what was next.</p><p>The point-to-point format worked great for this route. In contrast, out-and-back routes always follow a certain trajectory for me. At about 40% of the run, I start to dwell on the increasing inevitability of turning around, and second half of the run simply retraces steps. Point-to-point runs feel more inspiring as you commit to a plan and trust that you'll come out the other side. The 12-mile Ramage Peak Trail would be difficult—or at least unpleasant—to complete as an out-and-back run since most of the effort would be redundant, expended just getting into the trail and back out. As a one-way adventure though, it's sublime.</p><p>As a recommendation, <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/las-trampas">Las Trampas Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> is the easiest way to access the area, leaving you free to explore the most interesting areas without committing to a twenty mile trek. Plan ahead. Bring enough water. But definitely don't miss this one.</p><p><a href="">Back</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class="right-spacer"></div></div>

Alas, access was pretty definitively blocked by a locked gate. I'm certain a hop and a hundred meter jog would have put me on the connector trail, but I generally prefer to color inside the lines as far as trail access goes. I'm not generally impressed with some of the routes I've seen online where, out of disregard rather than any sort of need or even confusion, people simply cut across whatever land they please. So I considered it a nice hill warmup and opted for the road instead.</p><p><img src=\"moraga-to-castro-valley/moraga-to-castro-030-md-ce34ed1b.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-foot\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"2.1221412671856523\" style=\"min-height:720px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p>\n<img src=\"moraga-to-castro-valley/moraga-to-castro-035-md-e34807e3.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p><p>To tell the truth, I sort of get the appeal of the suburbs.

Maybe not a route I'll run all that frequently, but definitely the most inspiring.</p><p>The distance wasn't exceptional, but more than most, this route felt remarkably far away from everything—from anything. I wonder if that feeling would hold up upon repeating. Part of me knows that it's all just cow pasture, but for a moment while I was running, I let the trail take me away and I forgot about everything except putting one foot in front of the other and wondering what was next.</p><p>The point-to-point format worked great for this route. In contrast, out-and-back routes always follow a certain trajectory for me. At about 40% of the run, I start to dwell on the increasing inevitability of turning around, and second half of the run simply retraces steps. Point-to-point runs feel more inspiring as you commit to a plan and trust that you'll come out the other side. The 12-mile Ramage Peak Trail would be difficult—or at least unpleasant—to complete as an out-and-back run since most of the effort would be redundant, expended just getting into the trail and back out. As a one-way adventure though, it's sublime.</p><p>As a recommendation, <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/las-trampas\">Las Trampas Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> is the easiest way to access the area, leaving you free to explore the most interesting areas without committing to a twenty mile trek. Plan ahead. Bring enough water. But definitely don't miss this one.</p><p><a href=\"\">Back</a></p></div>","metadata":{"title":"Moraga to Castro Valley","date":"August 5, 2022","assets":{"100":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-100-sm-4941879b.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-100-md-4941879b.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-100-lg-4941879b.jpg"},"110":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-110-sm-22ad1713.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-110-md-22ad1713.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-110-lg-22ad1713.jpg"},"120":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-120-sm-8f9cb271.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-120-md-8f9cb271.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-120-lg-8f9cb271.jpg"},"130":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-130-sm-46606df0.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-130-md-46606df0.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-130-lg-46606df0.jpg"},"140":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-140-sm-0f32f057.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-140-md-0f32f057.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-140-lg-0f32f057.jpg"},"150":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-150-sm-13137393.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-150-md-13137393.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-150-lg-13137393.jpg"},"160":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-160-sm-e63198ad.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-160-md-e63198ad.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-160-lg-e63198ad.jpg"},"170":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-170-sm-9029d8e4.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-170-md-9029d8e4.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-170-lg-9029d8e4.jpg"},"180":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-180-sm-58615c02.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-180-md-58615c02.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-180-lg-58615c02.jpg"},"010":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-010-sm-f630d236.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-010-md-f630d236.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-010-lg-f630d236.jpg"},"020":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-020-sm-56d8e792.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-020-md-56d8e792.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-020-lg-56d8e792.jpg"},"025":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-025-sm-3b13c95a.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-025-md-3b13c95a.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-025-lg-3b13c95a.jpg"},"030":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-030-sm-ce34ed1b.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-030-md-ce34ed1b.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-030-lg-ce34ed1b.jpg"},"035":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-035-sm-e34807e3.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-035-md-e34807e3.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-035-lg-e34807e3.jpg"},"040":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-040-sm-70153d41.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-040-md-70153d41.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-040-lg-70153d41.jpg"},"050":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-050-sm-9730a599.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-050-md-9730a599.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-050-lg-9730a599.jpg"},"060":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-060-sm-5d6dd8ce.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-060-md-5d6dd8ce.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-060-lg-5d6dd8ce.jpg"},"070":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-070-sm-90a9b5a4.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-070-md-90a9b5a4.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-070-lg-90a9b5a4.jpg"},"080":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-080-sm-84a302ab.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-080-md-84a302ab.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-080-lg-84a302ab.jpg"},"090":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-090-sm-34b489f0.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-090-md-34b489f0.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-090-lg-34b489f0.jpg"},"resq":{"sm":"resqlink-sm-668acd09.jpg","md":"resqlink-md-668acd09.jpg","lg":"resqlink-lg-668acd09.jpg"}},"coverImage":"130","path":"moraga-to-castro-valley/","routeurl":"moraga-to-castro-valley/route-165e2bcb.json","bounds":[-122.13135,37.69124,-122.05505,37.84118]},"baseURL":"/trains-and-trails/"};
