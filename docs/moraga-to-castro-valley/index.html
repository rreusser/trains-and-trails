Thus, I decided to take a chance and plan a long run which would take advantage of early weekday bus schedules.

Though I still had an untouched 32 ounce water bottle, a quick stop by Safeway for pineapple juice and Gummy Lifesavers was worth the trouble.

After a few moments of reflection, I'm willing to say that this is the best route I've run in the East Bay. Maybe not a route I'll run all that frequently, but definitely the most inspiring.</p><p>The distance wasn't exceptional, but more than most, this route felt remarkably far away from everything—from anything. I wonder if that feeling would hold up upon repeating. Part of me knows that it's all just cow pasture, but for a moment while I was running, I let the trail take me away and I forgot about everything except putting one foot in front of the other and wondering what was next.</p><p>The point-to-point format worked great for this route. In contrast, out-and-back routes always follow a certain trajectory for me. At about 40% of the run, I start to dwell on the increasing inevitability of turning around, and second half of the run simply retraces steps. Point-to-point runs feel more inspiring as you commit to a plan and trust that you'll come out the other side. The 12-mile Ramage Peak Trail would be difficult—or at least unpleasant—to complete as an out-and-back run since most of the effort would be redundant, expended just getting into the trail and back out. As a one-way adventure though, it's sublime.</p><p>As a recommendation, <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/las-trampas">Las Trampas Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> is the easiest way to access the area, leaving you free to explore the most interesting areas without committing to a twenty mile trek. Plan ahead. Bring enough water. But definitely don't miss this one.</p><p><a href="">Back</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class="right-spacer"></div></div>

After a few moments of reflection, I'm willing to say that this is the best route I've run in the East Bay. Maybe not a route I'll run all that frequently, but definitely the most inspiring.</p><p>The distance wasn't exceptional, but more than most, this route felt remarkably far away from everything—from anything. I wonder if that feeling would hold up upon repeating. Part of me knows that it's all just cow pasture, but for a moment while I was running, I let the trail take me away and I forgot about everything except putting one foot in front of the other and wondering what was next.</p><p>The point-to-point format worked great for this route. In contrast, out-and-back routes always follow a certain trajectory for me. At about 40% of the run, I start to dwell on the increasing inevitability of turning around, and second half of the run simply retraces steps. Point-to-point runs feel more inspiring as you commit to a plan and trust that you'll come out the other side. The 12-mile Ramage Peak Trail would be difficult—or at least unpleasant—to complete as an out-and-back run since most of the effort would be redundant, expended just getting into the trail and back out. As a one-way adventure though, it's sublime.</p><p>As a recommendation, <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/parks/las-trampas\">Las Trampas Wilderness Regional Preserve</a> is the easiest way to access the area, leaving you free to explore the most interesting areas without committing to a twenty mile trek. Plan ahead. Bring enough water. But definitely don't miss this one.</p><p><a href=\"\">Back</a></p></div>","metadata":{"title":"Moraga to Castro Valley","date":"August 5, 2022","assets":{"100":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-100-sm-4941879b.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-100-md-4941879b.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-100-lg-4941879b.jpg"},"110":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-110-sm-22ad1713.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-110-md-22ad1713.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-110-lg-22ad1713.jpg"},"120":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-120-sm-8f9cb271.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-120-md-8f9cb271.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-120-lg-8f9cb271.jpg"},"130":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-130-sm-46606df0.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-130-md-46606df0.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-130-lg-46606df0.jpg"},"140":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-140-sm-0f32f057.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-140-md-0f32f057.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-140-lg-0f32f057.jpg"},"150":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-150-sm-13137393.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-150-md-13137393.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-150-lg-13137393.jpg"},"160":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-160-sm-e63198ad.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-160-md-e63198ad.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-160-lg-e63198ad.jpg"},"170":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-170-sm-9029d8e4.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-170-md-9029d8e4.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-170-lg-9029d8e4.jpg"},"180":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-180-sm-58615c02.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-180-md-58615c02.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-180-lg-58615c02.jpg"},"010":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-010-sm-f630d236.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-010-md-f630d236.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-010-lg-f630d236.jpg"},"020":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-020-sm-56d8e792.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-020-md-56d8e792.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-020-lg-56d8e792.jpg"},"025":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-025-sm-3b13c95a.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-025-md-3b13c95a.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-025-lg-3b13c95a.jpg"},"030":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-030-sm-ce34ed1b.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-030-md-ce34ed1b.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-030-lg-ce34ed1b.jpg"},"035":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-035-sm-e34807e3.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-035-md-e34807e3.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-035-lg-e34807e3.jpg"},"040":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-040-sm-70153d41.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-040-md-70153d41.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-040-lg-70153d41.jpg"},"050":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-050-sm-9730a599.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-050-md-9730a599.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-050-lg-9730a599.jpg"},"060":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-060-sm-5d6dd8ce.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-060-md-5d6dd8ce.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-060-lg-5d6dd8ce.jpg"},"070":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-070-sm-90a9b5a4.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-070-md-90a9b5a4.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-070-lg-90a9b5a4.jpg"},"080":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-080-sm-84a302ab.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-080-md-84a302ab.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-080-lg-84a302ab.jpg"},"090":{"sm":"moraga-to-castro-090-sm-34b489f0.jpg","md":"moraga-to-castro-090-md-34b489f0.jpg","lg":"moraga-to-castro-090-lg-34b489f0.jpg"},"resq":{"sm":"resqlink-sm-668acd09.jpg","md":"resqlink-md-668acd09.jpg","lg":"resqlink-lg-668acd09.jpg"}},"coverImage":"130","path":"moraga-to-castro-valley/","routeurl":"moraga-to-castro-valley/route-165e2bcb.json","bounds":[-122.13135,37.69124,-122.05505,37.84118]},"baseURL":"/trains-and-trails/"};
