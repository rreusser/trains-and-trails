We once found two domesticated rabbits which had been let loose near the parking lot, which we rescued and named Sibley and Huckleberry.

General advice is <a href="https://thethousandmiler.com/how-to-cross-water-safely/">not to cross a creek deeper than your knees</a>, and after just some wet feet from previous crossings, it looked like this one was set to exceed that threshold. Downstream a few feet, the water was significantly faster and the ditch deeper—but jumpable. Checking now, I see that the main entrance is closed due to flooding and rock slides.</p><p>After crossing successfully, I added an extra loop on the Tres Sendas Trail.

"Isn't this the best??" asked a random passerby. I heartily agreed.</p><p>Just a few feet farther along though, I encountered one of the trickiest crossings yet, tinged with the faint smell of a sewer. Left with few options and no desire to backtrack and seek an alternate park exit, I planted one foot firmly, stepped onto a tree stump, and jumped the remaining span.</p></div><svg class="articleCard_circleCutoff" width="20" height="10"><path d="M 0 0 L 20 0 L 20 10 A 14.5 14.5 0 0 0 0 10 Z"></path></svg></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-foot articleCard-start" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="1.744752872495558" style="min-height:160px"><div class="articleCard_station"><h2>Dimond Canyon Park</h2></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-foot" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="1.7552423495729603" style="min-height:400px"><div class="articleCard_content"><p><img src="de-laveaga-dimond-park-linkup/de-laveaga-dimond-park-linkup-120-md-962e6ac5.jpg" alt="A blurry photo from a waterlogged phone shows one last creek crossing"></p><p>I mean the running throughout was great, but as the run proceeded and the rain persisted, I became increasingly focused on the next creek crossing. Dimond Canyon cuts deep, so I opted to exit the park rather than proceed across a raging river. Pictured here is therefore the final crossing of today's run. I managed to cross by scrambling around an upstream tree and stepping across on a fallen log.</p></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-foot" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="1.7814660422664659" style="min-height:480px"><div class="articleCard_content"><p>Though I didn't want the run to end, my tolerance for creek crossings was, at last, exhausted.

Even though I didn't end up catching the bus home, it would have cut this route down to fifteen miles. Cutting off a couple loops would further reduced it to perhaps twelve or so.

I don't know if it's the terrain itself or if it's perhaps a psychological consequence of the fact that it used to require a special trail pass to access, but even though it's cow pasture dotted with power lines, something about it feels <em>real</em>. At any rate, the run gets going quickly with an immediate thousand foot ascent.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleCard articleCard-foot\" data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.1153842478514244\" style=\"min-height:520px\"><div class=\"articleCard_content\"><p><img src=\"de-laveaga-dimond-park-linkup/de-laveaga-dimond-park-linkup-020-md-ce7ea670.jpg\" alt=\"The De Laveaga Trail, shrouded in clouds.\"></p><p>An early photo shows the trail descending across the hills.
