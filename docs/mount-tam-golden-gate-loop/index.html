So I covered myself in sunscreen, threw seven energy gels and a banana into a small backpack, and headed out the door.</p></div><div class="articleCards"><div class="articleCards_marker"><div class="articleCards_markerInner"></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-metro articleCard-start" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="0" style="min-height:0px"><div class="articleCard_station"><h2>Lake Merritt Station</h2></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-metro" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="0" style="min-height:510px"><div class="articleCard_content"><p>

So it was as I waited at Civic Center for the 130 bus to Sausalito, looking cold in my running shorts. Across the street, a man climbed a sign post and waved his shirt at buses like a matador. At the BART entrance, a crowd of onlookers surrounded an all-out rolling-on-the-ground brawl. I was eager for the bus to arrive.</p></div></div><div class="articleCard articleCard-bus" data-route-mode="follow" data-route-progress="1.522218778856848" style="min-height:1829px"><div class="articleCard_content"><p>

I planned to stay on the bus longer, but to put it delicately, I was <em>well hydrated</em>.

When I get depleted on runs, my negative thoughts turn inward. Running is fundamentally a selfish pursuit, and seven hours on a trail gives you plenty of time to dwell on that thought. Even looking back, I mostly want to send a scenic snapshot to my family back home and file this run quietly away.

The weather was perfect, though a bit warm. The distance was long but not insurmountable. Water fountains presented themselves at just the right time.</p><p>With one more hop and an extra twenty minutes of transit to Mill Valley, it would be perfectly possible to make a seven mile out-and-back day of Mount Tam via the Temelpa trail. Other options abound, particularly in the Marin Headlands near the Golden Gate Bridge. I do wish I'd had the energy to visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/goga/pobo.htm">Point Bonita Lighthouse</a>. There's even a bus to Stinson Beach.</p><p>Of course I can't recommend a forty mile route as that's a choice you would need to make for yourself, but from any single part of the route through entire thing or longer, it's more than worth devoting a day to it.</p><p>The Super Bowl was alright.</p><p><a href="">← Back</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class="right-spacer"></div></div>
