Paired with the excellent accessibility and modest distance, the constantly-rolling hills make it plenty of a challenge and, all things considered, my number one choice for a weekday trail run.</p>\n<!--<span class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-1\"></span>-->\n<p><img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-000-md-f6f153c0.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>We start from the 12th Street Oakland BART station. If I've learned only one lesson on this project, it's to check the BART schedule on weekends! Trains might come every five minutes on a weekday, but you can easily find yourself waiting twenty minutes on the weekend schedule.</p>\n<p>From Oakland, Orinda is an easy 15 minute BART ride. During the above-ground portion, I like to preview the weather by watching the hills through the window.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"0\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-3\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-010-md-2c5c25c6.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.04\"></span>\nFrom the Orinda BART station, it's not more than a quarter of a mile to the De LaVeaga trailhead. It doesn't get much more convenient than that, though it requires a brief run along a sidewalk-free highway to get there.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.07\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-1\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.11\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-020-md-3cad9aaf.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>The trail immediately rises a thousand feet as it starts back westward, giving a birds-eye view of the Orinda BART station with Mount Diablo beckoning in the background. On clear days, I like to convince myself that you can just barely catch a glimpse of the distant snow-capped Sierras.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.11\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-2\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.265\"></span>\nThe top of the ridge is a welcome arrival after nine hundred feet of climbing, though the running doesn't get much easier from here.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.265\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-2\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.35\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-030-md-e1a118c2.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>I've often found myself driving along a highway, looking longingly out the window at the rolling hills, imagining I could find myself running among them. The moment I saw the De Laveaga trail, I realized <em>these are the hills I look out the window and long for</em>. Which is ironic then, because although it's one of the most beautiful vistas in the area, the constant ups and downs prevent the running from flowing easily.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.35\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-p5\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.37\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-040-md-17792695.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>I do understand that <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11644927/eucalyptus-how-californias-most-hated-tree-took-root-2\">they're moderately invasive</a>, but I just love the smell and the feel of the Bay Area's scattered eucalyptus groves.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.37\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-1\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.425\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-050-md-8acb3962.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>The trail is pretty rutted at the top. It's a constant reminder the natural state of these trails doesn't involve the sort of foot traffic they see. Sadly, it looks like <a href=\"https://www.ebparks.org/trail-maintenance-volunteers\">East Bay trail maintenance projects</a> are still on hold.\n<span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.425\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"article_spacer article_spacer-p5\"></div>\n<p><span data-route-mode=\"follow\" data-route-progress=\"1.45\"></span>\n<img src=\"de-laveaga/de-laveaga-060-md-85cccf95.jpg\" alt=\"Placeholder\"></p>\n<p>At last, we're treated with a view of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge as we start the descent down into Berkeley.
